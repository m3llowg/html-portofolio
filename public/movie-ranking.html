<h2>This is my first website project</h2>

<hr/>

<h2>Fight Club</h2>
<h3>David Fincher, 1999 </h3>
<p>
    This is a movies about masculinity, society, self and aspirations.<br/>
Sure, this is not the most healthy display of masculine attributes in today's society, I'm talking of course about the violence, the cigarette indulgence and burn marks
but at core it is the absolute default trait of masculinity, which is to have freedom.<br />
The freedom to do what you chose, how you chose to do it, and where you chose to do it. This is everything that at core any underdeveloped, emotionally staggared and fatigued 
man wants.<br />
Violence<br />
Cigarettes<br />
and Sex.

<h2>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h2>
<h3>Michel Gondry, 2004</h3>

<p>
This movie is a very futuristic yet basic and scrapped portrayal of what love is.
Although two people in love make each ther miserable at one point in their relationshiop,
they still somehow, and by whatever ends, end up polarised to each other.<br />
This is untamed loved, eventually tamed forgotten, then rediscovered.

<h2>Mr.Nobody</h2>
<h3>Jaco von Dormael, 2009</h3>

<p>
    This movie is life.<br />
    And by that I don't mean that this movie is so deep that only certain intelectualls would actually understand
    what this movie is, it surely can very easily be found corny in some aspects of the plot,
    but this movie is life because it portays and encapsulated what life is.<br />
    A small choice in a sunny afternoon can and will snowball into life altering, miracle aligners and 
    purgatorian retreats.
